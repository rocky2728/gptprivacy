# Privacy Policy

**Last updated — 06 May 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how the “BSSF GPT → Slack” integration
(“the Service”) collects, uses, and discloses information when you ask
the GPT to post messages to Slack.  It applies only to this Service and
not to other websites or applications.

## 1. Information We Collect
* **Channel identifiers** (e.g., `C012ABC`) and Slack user IDs you provide.  
* **Message content** (plain text and optional Block‑Kit JSON) you ask us to post.

## 2. How We Use Information
We forward the data above directly to Slack’s **chat.postMessage** API to
deliver your message. We do **not** use it for analytics, advertising,
or profiling.

## 3. Retention & Deletion
The proxy keeps **no persistent database** of message payloads.  Transient
server logs rotate every 24 hours and are permanently deleted within
seven days.

## 4. Sharing & Disclosure
Message data is shared only with Slack Technologies, LLC for the sole
purpose of posting to your workspace. We never sell, rent, or otherwise
disclose your data to third parties.

## 5. Security
All network traffic is encrypted via HTTPS/TLS.  The Slack bot token is
stored as a server‑side environment variable and is not exposed to end
users.

## 6. Your Choices
You control what data is sent by specifying the channel and message
content.  To remove a posted message, use Slack’s built‑in delete feature.
To revoke the bot’s access, remove it from your workspace or rotate the
token.

## 7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  We will post any
changes on this page and update the “Last updated” date above.
